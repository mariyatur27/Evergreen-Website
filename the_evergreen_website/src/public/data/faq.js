        question: "How does self storage compare to other real estate assets in regards to return on investment?",
        answer: "Self storage has the highest return on investment in comparison to any other real estate asset class. From 1994-2017, storage returned an annual average of 17.43%. Based on that annual average, $100,000 invested in 1994 would be over $4,000,000 today.",

        question: "Is self storage recession resilient?",
        answer: "From 2007-2009, self-storage dropped -3.8% in comparison to the S&P’s -22.0%. This was the smallest drop of any real estate asset class.",

        question: "Do banks like to loan on self storage?",
        answer: "From 2011-2018, self storage had the lowest default rate of any real estate asset class. When those rare few properties did default, the banks only lost an average of 1.52% per default. Lending on self storage is one of the safest loans a bank can make.",

    {
        question: "Is self storage easy to manage and operate?",
        answer: "Self storage often has one of the lowest expense ratios of real estate assets due to its minimal staffing requirements, simplified construction, and low turnover costs. By leveraging technology and online tools, self storage facilities can often be operated by a few key employees or even fully automated. The simplified construction of steel and concrete with reduced utilities results in lower ongoing maintenance. When a renter moves out, the turnover cost and process is not like a tenant moving out of an apartment; disposal and broom sweeping are all that are needed in most scenarios.",

    {
        question: "What is the ownership demographics of self storage?",
        answer: "Of the ~52,000 self storage facilities in the U.S., only 18% are owned by the 6 large REITS, and another 8% are owned by the next 100 largest operations. This leaves about 74% of facilities owned by “mom & pop” operators. ",

    },
    {
        question: "Is self storage subject to eviction laws?",
        answer: "No. Self storage is guided by lien (property) law as opposed to tenant/eviction law. This means self storage “loses” less days than any asset class that physically has people in it. When a renter is late on payment, their gate passcode is deactivated and their unit is over-locked. They are notified of their past due balance and if the delinquent unit does not come current, local lien law timelines are adhered to in for the auction process. Typically, the lien and auction timeline allows for the recovery of balances owed and new rental to a paying tenant within 60 days.",

    },
    {
        question: "Is the lien and auction timeline the same nationwide?",
        answer: "No. Each state has their own requirements for the lien and auction process. Typically, there are requirements of notification, a time period where the tenant has the ability to come current on balances owed, followed by public notice of auction, and then the sale of stored goods. Typically, the lien and auction timeline allows for the recovery of balances owed and new rental to a paying tenant within 60 days.",

    {
        question: "What is the break-even occupancy needed for self storage?",
        answer: "Un-leveraged self storage facilities have break-even occupancy figures in the low to mid 30% occupancy range. Leveraged assets have break-even occupancy figures in the low to mid 60% occupancy range. This is partially due to much lower overhead because of no “tenants, toilets, and trash”.",

    },
    {
        question: "What is a reactive pricing model?",
        answer: "With self storage, you can adjust pricing based on real time supply and demand. When a certain type of unit (ex. 10’ x 10’) is in low supply in the market/facility, the pricing can raise by as much as 50%+ and tenants may still rent them. Conversely, when a certain type of unit is in high supply in the market/facility, the pricing can decrease in order to encourage rentals. While this may seem like a basic concept, it’s not one that is as easily implemented in other real estate assets like multifamily, and certainly not to the same premium as available to self storage.",

    },
    {
        question: "Is rental income the only revenue stream available to a self storage facility?",
        answer: "No. Self storage facilities implement a large number of ancillary revenue streams. In addition to unit rentals, a facility can experience income from packing and moving supplies, lock sales, truck rentals, business center income, renters insurance commissions, vehicle parking, cell tower leases, billboard advertisements, and more.",
